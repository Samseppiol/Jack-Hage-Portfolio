Had a full working site for a galaxy s5 but zero responsiveness what so ever. Started making small changes with reference to my figma mockup. Once again mockups proving to be so incredibly valuable(a week ago I was saying what a waste of time they were, had it all planned out in my head. BAD IDEA). Got ipad responsiveness working with media queries. Also implemented a fixed nav-bar which follows wherever you scroll. Did it by accident trying to achieve something else but I liked it so kept it. Adding final touches like proper hyperlinks.

Spent all day coding up a solution to my figma mockups. I think I have it damn near perfect, I have changed a few things along the way like padding sizes and borders etc. The indecisiveness was so strong. Every few minutes thinking about making everything responsive then calming myself down and reminding myself to just get mobile working first. Deciding to use boot strap then deciding not to use bootstrap at least 5 different times. I eventually stuck it out and wrote pure css and html. Finally got something I was happy with.


21-03-2017: So today I got home, ate then sat down at my computer for 5 or 6 hours on end and completely
redesigned my website in figma. I created three mockups, galaxy s5, ipad and desktop size. I really realised the significant importance of mockups when creating your website after my teacher Patrick did a demo.

17-03-2017. Today we finished our mockups/wireframes. I experimented with several different header/background images as well as different text fonts, sizes and colours. I have the basic html structure down with a small amount of styling
