      <h3> What am I doing? </h3>
      <p>
        I am currently undertaking a bootcamp at Coder Factory in Melbourne Australia,
        where I am learning to become a full stack web developer. In six months I am
        learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, ReactJs and NodeJs.

      <h3> Why?</h3>
      <p>
        I have always been enthusiastic with tech and programming, starting when I was 15.
        The last few years I have been stuck in a rut, so I decided to pull myself out and
        make a change! I am taking each day one step at a time.

      <h3> Where have I been?</h3>
      <p>
        For the last four years I have worked in multiple industries. Hospitality
        for a year and for the last three years warehousing and logistics.
        Neither industry particularly motivated me and I wasn't passionate about either. They were
        more of a placeholder until I decided what to do for a career.

      <h3> What about me?</h3>
      <p>
        In my spare time I love to travel, international and around Australia. I have an obsession with football,
        a mad Real Madrid supporter and I love music! All kinds from hard trance to Hans Zimmer. I am also seriously
        addicted to udemy courses.
